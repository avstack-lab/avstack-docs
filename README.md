# avstack-docs
Documentation and how-to-guides for the autonomous vehicle libraries. 

## Starting up

To serve the docs on your local machine for evaluating changes, do the following.

- `make install` to install the poetry environment
- `make docs` to serve the docs. Default is port 8000
- Go to a browser and enter `localhost:8000`. Your docs should be showing up locally!

## Making changes

### How-to-guides 

The guides are saved in `docs/how-to-guides`. Some are pure markdown files while some are jupyter notebooks. The jupyter notebooks will, of course, require you to run a jupyter server to evaluate and modify them.
